My assessment:

The purpose of this challenge is calculate a sales forecast for the
next week using a given dataset of transactions from a restaurant. To
achieve this, the most important is see how much was spent in the past
weeks (days). I have identified the details that follow:
- The restaurant opens Mon-Sat.
- There are data for 3 weeks.
- The first Monday data is missing.
So, we have only 3 values by day of the week. A complex theory would
not be useful in this case. A simple mean estimation is enough.

The results "mean (+-s.t.)":
M: 6038.07 (+-39.70).
T: 6623.04 (+-188.71).
W: 8676.71 (+-1171.73).
T: 4290.95 (+-1836.57).
F: 3014.15 (+-134.43).
S: 3619.54 (+-340.14).
S: 0.00 (+-0.00).

A plot is available in 'results.jpg'.
